  University Researcher<br>
  PI of the WAVESTORMS project<br>
  <br>
   Lucile obtained her PhD at LPP in France in 2014, which focused on the interaction of magnetic clouds with Earthâ€™s bow shock. She then worked for a couple of years at the European Space Agency in the Netherlands, before joining the Space Physics group at the University of Helsinki in 2017 as a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellow. Her research interests lie in dayside magnetospheric processes, with a special emphasis in shock and foreshock physics and ultra-low frequency waves. In her work, she uses both spacecraft observations and numerical simulations to understand the interconnections between processes occurring in different regions of near-Earth space. Recent highlights include studies of foreshock wave transmission [Turc et al., 2023; 2025a], and the first Vlasiator global simulation of a foreshock bubble [Turc et al., 2025b]. The parts of her work she enjoys the most are starting new projects, mentoring students and early-career researchers, and writing up a paper, when things finally fall neatly into place. In her free time, she likes to sing, listen to music, read fantasy books, knit, and hike (among many other things).
