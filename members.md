  <p>
  Associate Professor <br>
  PI of the WAVESTORMS project<br>
  <br>
   Lucile obtained her PhD at LPP in France in 2014, which focused on the interaction of magnetic clouds with Earth’s bow shock. She then worked for a couple of years at the European Space Agency in the Netherlands, before joining the Space Physics group at the University of Helsinki in 2017 as a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellow. Her research interests lie in dayside magnetospheric processes, with a special emphasis in shock and foreshock physics and ultra-low frequency waves. In her work, she uses both spacecraft observations and numerical simulations to understand the interconnections between processes occurring in different regions of near-Earth space. Recent highlights include studies of foreshock wave transmission [Turc et al., 2023; 2025a], and the first Vlasiator global simulation of a foreshock bubble [Turc et al., 2025b]. The parts of her work she enjoys the most are starting new projects, mentoring students and early-career researchers, and writing up a paper, when things finally fall neatly into place. In her free time, she likes to sing, listen to music, read fantasy books, knit, and hike (among many other things).

  <p>
  Postdoctoral Researcher<br>
  Humble member of the WAVESTORMS project <br>
  <br>
Souhail is a postdoctoral researcher in the Space Physics Group at the University of Helsinki. His research focuses on near-Earth plasma dynamics, with a particular interest in dayside magnetic reconnection and foreshock physics. He investigates these processes through a combination of spacecraft observations and numerical simulations. Souhail earned his PhD from IRAP (Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Planétologie) in Toulouse in 2024, where he studied magnetic reconnection and flux transfer events (<a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-05034691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thesis link</a>). Outside of science, Souhail enjoys playing both classical and electric guitar.

  <img src="/assets/img/Veera.png" alt="Veera Lipsanen" style="width: 220; height: 294px; border-radius: 50%; margin-right: 24px;">

  <p>
  Doctoral researcher<br>
  Regular member of the WAVESTORMS project<br>
  <br>
Veera is a doctoral researcher in the space physics group at the University of Helsinki. Her research focuses on wave activity driven by foreshock transients and understanding the solar wind context of foreshock transient formation. She uses ground and spacecraft observations and, in the future, also numerical simulations. Before starting her PhD, she worked as a research assistant in the group for two summers, studying ULF waves. In her free time, she likes to take walks with her dog, do all kinds of crafts, and read.

## Msc. Shi Tao (陶石, Táo Shí)

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 1em;">
  <img src="/assets/img/TaoShi.jpg" alt="TaoShi" style="width: 220; height: 263px; border-radius: 50%; margin-right: 24px;">

  <p>
  Doctoral researcher<br>
  Quiet member of the WAVESTORMS project<br>
  <br>
TaoShi is currently a doctoral researcher in the Wavestorms group at University of Helsinki. His research interests include magnetospheric convection, magnetosphere–ionosphere coupling, and foreshock transients. He completed Bachelor’s degree in space physics at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, a major city in southern China. He worked on quantifying magnetospheric convection using Vlasiator during his master’s studies and is now focusing on the identification of foreshock transients and studying their impacts on the Earth’s magnetosphere. The aim of his doctoral thesis is to investigate wave activity and particle loss in near-Earth space associated with foreshock transients. In his spare time, he enjoys singing and playing Go, a strategic board game.
