  caption: "Overview of the equatorial plane near-Earth space in a quasi-radial interplanetary magnetic field configuration, with the foreshock extending far into the upstream of Earth, as simulated with the Vlasiator model. The figure combines two colormaps which both show the ion density, but with ranges selected to highlight fluctuations in the magnetosheath and in the foreshock. Image credit: Lucile Turc, Vlasiator."
