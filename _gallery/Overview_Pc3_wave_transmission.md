caption: "Overview of near-Earth space, with the main steps of the transmission pathways of foreshock 30-second waves: (1) generation in the foreshock, (2) transmission through the magnetosheath, (3) entry into the magnetosphere in the equatorial region as fast-mode waves (3a) coupling with field line resonances (4a) and at high latitudes via modulated precipitation (3b) resulting in variations of the ionospheric conductivity (4b), eventually leading to (5) the observations of Pc3 pulsations on the ground.
