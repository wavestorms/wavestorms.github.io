WAVESTORMS is a 5-year research project (2024-2029), titled <i>Impact of foreshock transients on near-Earth space</i> and funded by the European Research Council through a Consolidator grant (project number 101124500). 

The project focuses on foreshock transients, small-scale structures created by kinetic processes upstream of Earth's bow shock, which can grow to sizes comparable to or larger than Earth's and cause large-scale disturbances in near-Earth space. There exists many types of foreshock transients [[e.g. Zhang et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11214-021-00865-0); [Kajdic et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.3389/fspas.2024.1436916)], and our work centres on the largest of these structures, which are generated when solar wind directional discontinuities interact with the shock and the foreshock: foreshock bubbles and hot flow anomalies. Our project encompasses all aspects of foreshock transients, from their formation conditions and the solar wind context in which they form, to their interaction with the shock and their role in particle acceleration, to their impact inside Earth's magnetosphere.

Our work is organised around three lines of research:
(1) the impact of foreshock transients on the outer regions of near-Earth space,
(2) their impact on the inner magnetosphere, and
(3) their sources in the solar wind and their role in wave storms.
The synthesis of our efforts will allow us to answer the overarching science question of this project: what is the contribution of foreshock transients to near-Earth space dynamics?

To study foreshock transients and their impact, our team uses a combination of numerical simulations conducted with the Vlasiator model [[Palmroth et al., 2018]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41115-018-0003-2) and multi-point spacecraft and ground-based observations available across near-Earth space, including for example data from the [MMS](https://mms.gsfc.nasa.gov/), [Cluster](https://csa.esac.esa.int/csa-web/) and [THEMIS](https://themis.ssl.berkeley.edu/index.shtml) missions, as well as ground-based magnetometer measurements from the [SuperMAG network](https://supermag.jhuapl.edu/).
